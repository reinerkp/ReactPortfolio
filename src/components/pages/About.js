      Hi! My name is Katherine Reiner, and I am currently a student at the Univsersity of Denver's coding bootcamp. Below you will find a portfolio of different applications that I have developed throughout my carrer. These applications show an array of skills using JAVASCRIPT, HTML, and CSS. Currently, I work at Charles Schwab on the Trader Services Team as a liscnesed broker. I am interested in using both my finance and web development skills in the future. I am a Colorado native, inheritely meaning that I love to be outside. I also love to travel, in the new year I hope to do my first international travel. Please reach out with any questions, contact informaiton is provided below.
